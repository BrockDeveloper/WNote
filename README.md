# WNote
## Create and manage quick notes from the Windows cmd

### Requirements
- Windows operating system

### When to use it?
When you want a quick way to save a note and easily retrieve it without using temporary txt files on the desktop or in some remote folder: with WNote everything is organized!

### How to use it?
- run the command "note -s" to setup the notes folder (it will be created in your default "My Documents" Windows folder)
- Now you can:
  - create a new note
  - view a note
  - copy a note to the clipboard
  - manage the note
- To view the command syntax, run "note" with no parameters.
- I suggest you add the program to the environment variables, to use the command from cmd quickly:
  - Type in search bar "environment..." and choose Edit the system environment variables which opens up the System Properties window
  - Click the Environment Variables... button
  - In the Environment Variables tab, double click the Path variable in the System variables section
  - Add the path to the folder containing the wnote.exe to the Path by double clicking on the empty line and paste the path.
  - Click ok and exit. Open a new cmd prompt and hit the command from any folder and it should work.
